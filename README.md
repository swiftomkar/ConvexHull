# ConvexHull
Wiki: The convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it.

* 2D convex hull is a convex hull on a set of points in an x-y plane. This is easier and moderately compiute intensive 
* We propose, in this project to make a 3D convex hull. The points here have x-y-z co-ordinates.
* In future we propose to slice the set of points into sections to be distributd across nodes for computing clice-convex-hulls
* These slice-convex-hulls can be merged together on the master node
